1. Title of the Project:
"Who is the Killer?" – A Scenario-Based Investigative Game Using OOP in C++
________________________________________
2. Objective:
The primary aim of this project is to design and develop an interactive game titled "Who is the Killer?", which evaluates users' analytical thinking, deduction, and IQ by placing them in a simulated mystery scenario. The project will use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++ to ensure modularity, reusability, and a clean code structure.

3. Game Description:
The player is presented with a murder case. There are:
•	Characters: each with alibis, professions, and possible motives.
•	Clues: scattered across the game, some misleading (red herrings).
•	Questions and Events: triggered based on user choices.
The player must analyze the clues and character responses to deduce who the killer is within limited attempts. The player would be given a specific points limit after which he is unable to continue the game.

5. Features and Functionality:
•	Character Profiles: Each character is modeled using classes with attributes (name, age, alibi, motive, status).
•	Clue System: Clues are objects that can be discovered and examined.
•	Decision Tracker: Tracks choices to dynamically change outcomes.
•	Hint System (optional): Limited hints that affect final scoring.

6. Implementation:
The project will be implemented in C++ using the following OOP concepts:
OOP Concept	Application in Game
Classes/Objects	Characters, Clues, Game Engine, Inventory
Inheritance	Specialized character roles (e.g., Police, Suspect)
Encapsulation	Access modifiers to restrict direct manipulation of data
Polymorphism	Different responses based on character type or user choice
Constructors	Initialize characters and clues dynamically
File Handling	(Optional) Save progress or load new scenarios
________________________________________
9. Evaluation Criteria:
The player will be evaluated based on:
•	Number of attempts taken to solve the mystery.
•	Logical flow of choices made.
•	Correct identification of the killer.
•	Optional: Hint usage, clue accuracy.

10. Conclusion:
"Who is the Killer?" is a unique blend of gaming and logical reasoning, designed with object-oriented C++ to create an engaging educational experience. It stands as a powerful demonstration of how software concepts can be used creatively to stimulate analytical skills in an interactive format.
